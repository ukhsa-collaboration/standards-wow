## How to read the guidelines

The following terms are used throughout this guidance to indicate the strength of each requirement.
These are adapted from [RFC 2119][3] and contextualised for UKHSA:

- **MUST**: This requirement is mandatory. It applies universally and must be followed without exception unless formally approved.
- **MUST NOT**: This action is explicitly prohibited. It must not be taken under any circumstances unless an approved exception is in place.
- **SHOULD**: This is a strong recommendation. There may be valid reasons to deviate, but the implications must be understood, justified and documented.
- **SHOULD NOT**: This is a strong recommendation against a practice. Exceptions may exist, but they must be carefully considered, justified and documented.
- **MAY**: This is an optional practice or recommendation. Teams may choose to adopt it based on context, value or preference.
