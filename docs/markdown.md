# Markdown Help

## Introduction

Pages are typically made up of simple markdown.
Here are some examples:

### Bold

**bold text**

### Italic

*italicized text*

### Blockquote

> blockquote

### Ordered List

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item

Note that you should not list the numbers in order `1., 2., 3.`, but instead use `1.` all the way through.
This will be checked and fixed by the linting and formatting rules present in this repository.

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### Code

`code` or for blocks:

```python
print("hello, world")
```

Note that you can specify the language too.

### Link

[external][1] or [relative][2].

### Table

| Syntax | Description |
| - | - |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |

### Callouts

There are several types of callout you can use:

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note callout

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip callout

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an important callout

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning callout

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution callout
