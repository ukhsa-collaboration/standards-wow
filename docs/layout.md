# Layout Help

## Introduction

This is an example of a basic page.

The `order` key above specifies the order this page appears in the navigation on the left of the page.
This navigation is provided by the [GovUK Eleventy Plugin][1] and is configured in the `standards-template.11tydata.json` file in this directory.
